<b> A Story for Story's Sake</b>

Plenty have taken to the pen
To explain, but more accurately 
Release
Emotions because it is innately human to tell,
And ask why,
And delve into things beyond ourselves.
 
But 

For once may I say?
All this analysis and explanation.
This need for evidence and corroboration.
When what is truly incredible,
Is when a story can simply
Be. 

An idea transmitted in fluid
Understood in full by few but felt by all.
So please.
Forget your philosophies.
Your depth
Your deeper meanings

Because many of us 
Spend our lives
Without really living
Or 
Without really being,
Real
