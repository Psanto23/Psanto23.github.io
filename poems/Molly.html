<pre class="poem">

<b>Molly</b>

Ink ghosts into my sweaty skin,
Cicadas of late summer sing,
Without me and I won’t be here.

Under ferns and morels her bones decay,
A calico coat folding in time and day.
Forever as a part of all,
But tomorrow I won’t be here.

And when I get back,
The trees will be thick.
Small hands won’t mock its bark,
Doves don’t mourn after dark.
My solemn path bends and writhes,
But she will always remain.

My childhood hums beside her,
Buried delicately, indefinitely.
