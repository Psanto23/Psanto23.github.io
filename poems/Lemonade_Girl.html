<pre class="poem">

<b>Lemonade Girl</b>

Little drops of sunshine fall from her head
Warm yet refreshing they spill onto my skin
Golden yellow and bright

Waves that lap the shore sit softly in her eyes
Wonder filled, restless they stain my mind 
Deeply blue and bright 

Ink dances on her legs when she walks
Figures jump off they ask me to join her art
Dark sleek yet bright 

she must be a fantasy
At best a mirage 
Lemonade girl 
From beyond
