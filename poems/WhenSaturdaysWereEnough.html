<pre class="poem">

<b> When Saturdays Were Enough</b>

When Saturdays were enough
I was embraced by sunshine
That warmed me
Held me
For an unending time

When Saturdays were enough
Simplicity washed over me 
I could walk anywhere
See anything 
Or maybe just fall back to sleep

When Saturdays were enough
My plans were neverending
I climbed mountains 
Sailed seas
But mostly did just nothing

When Saturdays were enough
It didn’t matter if it was something
But now I care
What I do
When I do
And how much too
Yet I’m still never enough
